# Modular Task Light

Modular Task Light is a compact, articulated, and modular task lamp designed to mount on 2020 aluminum profiles. It features interchangeable modules, adjustable joints, and a simple mechanical design, making it easy to adapt, customize, and extend for workshop and maker setups.

To assemble the lamp, the following hardware is required:

- M3 × 30 mm socket head cap screws
- M3 hex nuts
- M5 × 12 mm socket head cap screws
- M5 T-nuts for 2020 aluminum profiles

The knurled nuts are used as adjustment and locking elements.
See the photos below for details on how to assemble and install the 3D-printed knurled nuts.

This lamp was designed live on my [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/barbatroniclive), and the full project is available here on GitHub. It can also be downloaded from [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/fr/models/2171696-modular-task-light#profileId-2355550).

The project was created using FreeCAD. All source files are provided and can be modified, including key parameters such as the arm length, to adapt the lamp to different setups and needs.

For customization, the knurled nuts can be printed in an accent color to add a visual highlight while keeping the rest of the lamp simple and functional.

For the lamp module, you can use the official [Bambu Lab light model](https://eu.store.bambulab.com/products/led-lamp-kit-001), but it is relatively expensive.
Equivalent alternatives can be found on platforms like [AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c43TVm4N) or [Amazon](https://amzn.to/4baGwnv).
